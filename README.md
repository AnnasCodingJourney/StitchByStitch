# StitchByStitch
A mobile application created on Dart/flutter. The app enables users to post knitting projects, follow tutorials to learn how to knit and meet other knitters at events. This was part of a course at the University of Strathclyde MSc. in Software Development and was established by 2 fellow students and myself. The app is based on my design on Figma.
